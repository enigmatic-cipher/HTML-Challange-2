        <p><img src="Image.jpg" alt="The Batman Movie Poster" width="300" height="300"><i><h2>Overview</h2><br>The Batman is a 2022 American superhero 
            film based on the DC Comics character Batman. Produced by Warner Bros. Pictures, DC Films, 6th & Idaho, and Dylan Clark 
            Productions, and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, it is a reboot of the Batman film franchise. The film was directed 
            by Matt Reeves, who wrote the screenplay with Peter Craig. It stars Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne / Batman alongside Zoë 
            Kravitz, Paul Dano, Jeffrey Wright, John Turturro, Peter Sarsgaard, Andy Serkis, and Colin Farrell. The film sees Batman, 
            who has been fighting crime in Gotham City for two years, uncover corruption while pursuing the Riddler (Dano), a serial 
            killer who targets Gotham's elite.

            Development began after Ben Affleck was cast as Batman in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) in 2013. Affleck signed on to 
            direct, produce, co-write, and star in The Batman, but had reservations about the project and dropped out. Reeves took 
            over and reworked the story, removing the DCEU connections. He sought to explore Batman's detective side more than previous 
            films, drawing inspiration from the films of Alfred Hitchcock and the New Hollywood era, and comics such as Year One (1987), 
            The Long Halloween (1996–97), and Ego (2000). Pattinson was cast in May 2019, with further casting in late 2019. Principal 
            photography took place in the UK and Chicago between January 2020 and March 2021.

            The Batman premiered at Lincoln Center, New York, on March 1, 2022, and was theatrically released worldwide on March 4. 
            It was delayed twice from an initial June 2021 release date due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film has grossed over $759 
            million against a $185–200 million budget, making it the highest-grossing film of 2022, and received praise for the performances, 
            cinematography, Reeves' direction, action sequences, and story, though some criticized its runtime. It is intended to launch a 
            Batman shared universe, with two sequels planned and two spin-off television series in development for HBO Max.
            On Halloween, Gotham City mayor Don Mitchell Jr. is murdered by a man calling himself the Riddler. Reclusive billionaire 
            Bruce Wayne, who has operated for two years as the vigilante Batman, investigates alongside the Gotham City Police Department 
            (GCPD). At the crime scene, lieutenant James Gordon discovers a message that the Riddler left for Batman. Soon after, the Riddler 
            kills commissioner Pete Savage and leaves another message for Batman.
